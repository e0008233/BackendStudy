https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies/
Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

 

 

Example 1:

Input: g = [1,2,3], s = [1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.
Example 2:

Input: g = [1,2], s = [1,2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. 
You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, 
You need to output 2.
 

Constraints:

1 <= g.length <= 3 * 104
0 <= s.length <= 3 * 104
1 <= g[i], s[j] <= 231 - 1



因为饥饿度最小的孩子最容易吃饱，所以我们先考虑这个孩子。为了尽量使得剩下的饼干可 以满足饥饿度更大的孩子，所以我们应该把大于等于这个孩子饥饿度的、且大小最小的饼干给这 个孩子。满足了这个孩子之后，我们采取同样的策略，考虑剩下孩子里饥饿度最小的孩子，直到 没有满足条件的饼干存在。
