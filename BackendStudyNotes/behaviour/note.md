Why do you want to work as an integration Support Engineer (explain how your experience will help you in the role)
1. Whatsapp is a leading company in communication. It has over 5 billion downloads and 2 millions active users every day. I am interested in the technology stack it is using to support such a large amount of network traffic and handle its business.
2. The job requirements match my past experience. The team is looking for someone who can provide technical support and foster business relationships with the customers. As for myself, currently I am working as a backend service engineer. As it is a small team, other than developing features, we need to communicate real time support to our frontend team. Most of the time, I need to troubleshoot the trading services, svip services, and gifting services for our svip users.

What is your greatest professional achievement?
- Why this achievement makes you proud? Recognition from the peers
- Relevant skills make you grow. 
- Work as a team 
We delivered the new feature within one week due to the urgent marketing needs. As a live steaming company, we have some very popular hosts that can earn lots of diamonds from our customers.
And in return, we need to pay the salary to the hosts monthly, and that's a lot of money. Our product team found out that those hosts are interacting frequently with other hosts and sending gifts as well.
So instead of troublesome top up procedure, we can enable hosts to send gifts to others through their salary. So we developed this new finance system and get it tested within one week. 
I was the main developer for the feature, and i needed to take database design, transaction history, security, and data consistency into consideration. We have reduced our cash payment by 30%. 
From the brainstorming, development, testing, and release, it only took one week. We all worked as a team to make it happen. 
  

What is your biggest challenge?
When I firstly joined the team, I need to update our recommendation tab. Al it is our core functionality, I need to understand the whole livestreaming logic before I can make the change.
As it we are using micro-services, many services are dependent on one anther. To have a better understanding of our livestreaming workflow, I went through all the documents available, clear my doubts with seniors and draw the flowchart. 
With better understanding, I am able to develop more easily, and I have kept the habit of drawing flowchart for all api I have developed and posted it on Confluence. 


Teamwork or individual work
